## Dataset Description Copied from Kaggle

This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 1.5 million accident records in this dataset.

## Overview

This project consists of some exploratory data analysis and visualization with the plotly package. Some examples of questions I answered with this project were:
* What times of the day have the most car accidents?
* How does the number of accidents fluctuate throughout the week?
* How does accidents per capita look across the states?
* How does total number of accidents vary across the states?

## Note
Some data was recently removed from this dataset so I have good reason to be the dataset is a bit flawed. Which exact data that was removed was not given so I was unable to account for any specific error in my analysis with that respect.
